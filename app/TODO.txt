TODO:

When opening app for the first time you could :
 - Join an existing group by entering a Node's invitation :
        - If you are already in the group, you will enter your username/password, the app will
        check if theses are valid, it will then show you files inside this one and ask you which to pull.
        - If you are not in the group, it will ask you for a new username/password which is free and ask the sender of
        the invitation.
 - Create a new group, and send invitation.

 When opening the app :
 - Show all groups
